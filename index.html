                    Hi King. Know you're going through this tough time, but as 2Pac said you're "a soldier". 
                    It's hard sometimes to take time and slow down when you're being a caretaker, doing your music, earning every dollar, 
                    and looking out for people you love. Yet you persevere through it all waking up with hope the next morning. And that is exactly how a king would be, no? Diplomatic, enthralling, inspiring, looking after the kingdom and warding off danger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a Gemini, you are water and fire; and you can switch when you feel like it. Sometimes it feels the ocean would drown you, but you can also turn the water to vapor. We know you know all of this about yourself; but sometimes it's nice to hear it. 
                    So love yourself a little more and look through below while you rest or are stressed:
                </p>
